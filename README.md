# Dummy-Login-JWT-Authentication
Created a dummy login endpoint that verifies hardcoded user credentials and returns a JWT token. Implemented token generation, expiry handling, decoding logic, and role extraction. Integrated secure routes needing token authentication and verified the full process through Swagger and Postman testing.
